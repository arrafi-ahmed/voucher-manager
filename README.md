# Deployment Guide:

Quick step-by-step guide to get you up and running:

1. **Install** Node.js and PostgreSQL on your machine.
2. **Create a local PostgreSQL database**, then update the database settings in `api/.env.development` to match your setup.
3. **Run the schema file** `api/schema-pg.sql` to create the necessary tables in your new database.
4. In the project’s root directory, open a terminal and run the manual deployment script:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   This will launch the app locally at `http://localhost:3000/`. If it doesn’t load the first time, just try refreshing the page.

Once it’s deployed, you’ll be able to start using the app.
